This code reuses (lightly edits) example code from:

    weewx 3.2.0    Tom Keffer and the weewx team
    weewx-wd 1.0   Gary Roderick and the weewx-wd team
    xstats 0.2     Matthew Wall

I've taken the liberty to mostly remove their names from
the content herein to try to ensure that bugs/complaints/requests
come to me only, but the credit goes to them :-)
