The question of memory usage, and potentially memory leaks, is something
that comes up frequently on the weewx Google Group.

In the past Tom posted some code that used some typically unused fields
in the standard weewx database for v2 weewx.

Similarly, Matthew Wall has provided his pmon and cmon extensions that
took a different measurement tact ('ps' versus '/proc').

Most recently Matthew updated pmon to v0.2 as a demonstration extension
using the new v3 feature that supports multiple databases.

This extension combines the two essentially.

For clarity, I've removed any copyright notices and version identifiers
from Matthew's orginal work, mainly so nobody's confused re: who did what.

At the same time, I want to definitely recognize (and thank) mwall for
doing the heavy lifting and sharing his extension with the weewx community,
as well as Tom as always for weewx.

To summarize:
  - all the credit for this one should go to Matthew/Tom.
  - any blame of course should go to me :-)
