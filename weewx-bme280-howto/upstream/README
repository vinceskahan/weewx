This is the upstream weewx extension code from wjcarpenter on gitlab
https://gitlab.com/wjcarpenter/bme280wx/-/archive/master/bme280wx-master.zip

Any credit for this cool extension goes to wjcarpenter

This appears to be their version as of May 27 2020, which still works for me
today in mid 2025.

This is copied here for safekeeping just to have all the pieces together
and for disaster recovery purposes.
