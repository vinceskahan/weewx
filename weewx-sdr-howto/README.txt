This repo attempts to capture a weewx-sdr HOWTO end to end as tested here on weewx v5 pip.

howto.txt                the detailed HOWTO step-by-step
sdr.py                   modified sdr.py per https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-sdr/pull/184
sdr.py.orig              the original upstream sdr.py from mwall
weewx.conf.sdr_section   my SDR section for weewx.conf for WH31B, WH32, WH51 sensors here


If you go through the howto and somehow edit your sdr.py incorrectly, the copy here
reflects a fully edited version you can drop into place.
