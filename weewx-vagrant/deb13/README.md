## Vagrant configuration for weewx on x86_84

This tree contains a Vagrantfile and scripts to configure weewx and optionally many add-ons.  See the Vagrantfile for configurable items.

### NOTE

This uses a bento box since the Debian project is looney about (heaven forbid) Hashicorp and their updated license terms for Vagrant.  Zealots. Sheesh...
