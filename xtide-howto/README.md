## README FIRST
This bash script automates building and installing xtide.
See the .sh script for howto and credits.

In short - edit ${SRCDIR} near the top then run the script.


### Alternate way
This is much quicker.

### Test 
/usr/local/bin/tide -fc -df'%Y.%m.%d' -tf'%H:%M' -l'Des Moines, East Passage, Puget Sound, Washington' -b'2026-01-20 00:00' -e'2026-02-17 00:00'

(or /usr/bin/tide if you have it there)
